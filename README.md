# Project-Local-Library

## Introduction
Welcome to the Local Library project! Our goal is to bring a modern and organized library experience to your neighborhood. This web application has been designed to meet the needs of community members who want easy access to books and to improve their reading habits.

This project requires a proficient understanding of front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS, and a solid foundation in JavaScript programming. The codebase makes use of the latest ECMAScript features, including template literals, destructuring, and arrow functions, to create a seamless user experience.

## Skills Demonstrated

Developers familiar with Visual Studio Code as a text editor will have an advantage in working on this project. A comprehensive understanding of JavaScript error types, debugging techniques, and proper syntax usage of let, const, and var are essential to success. The application also utilizes array manipulation techniques such as find(), filter(), map(), some(), every(), reduce(), and sort() to handle and display data.
